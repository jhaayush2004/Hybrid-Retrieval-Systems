# Hybrid-Retrieval-Systems
Hybrid Retrieval System combining keyword matching (BM25) with semantic similarity (Vectorstore) for improved retrieval.
Here's a short description of a hybrid retrieval system using `keyword_retriever` and `vectorstore_retriever`:

**Combines Efficiency and Semantics:** This hybrid retrieval system leverages two retrieval methods to improve search results:

* **Keyword-retriever (e.g., BM25):** This retriever efficiently finds documents containing keywords from the user's query. It's fast and works well for identifying relevant documents based on literal matches.
* **Vectorstore Retriever (embedding-based):** This retriever utilizes vector representations (embeddings) to identify documents with similar meaning to the query, even if they don't share the exact keywords. Vectorstore likely refers to a storage and retrieval system for these embeddings.

**Improved Accuracy:** By combining the strengths of both methods, this hybrid approach aims to retrieve documents that are not only relevant based on keywords but also semantically similar to the user's intent.

**Potential Benefits:**

* More comprehensive and accurate retrieval results compared to using a single method.
* Can handle queries with synonyms or paraphrasing where keyword-based retrieval might struggle.

**Example Use Case:**

Imagine searching for documents on "electric cars." The keyword retriever might find documents mentioning "electric vehicles" or "EVs," while the vectorstore retriever could identify documents about "Tesla" or "charging stations" based on semantic similarity. The hybrid system would combine these results to provide a more informative set of documents.


## langchain_community VS langchain.core:

**langchain.core:**

* Focuses on the core functionalities of LangChain. 
* Contains the essential building blocks like the LangChain Expression Language and fundamental abstractions used throughout the framework. 
* Considered lightweight and can be used independently for projects requiring just core LangChain functionalities.

**langchain_community:**

* Offers integrations with various third-party services and tools. 
* These integrations are built on top of the core abstractions provided by langchain.core. 
* Examples include integrations with OpenAI's chat model or tools for working with Gmail.
* Maintained by the LangChain community, allowing for flexibility and wider integration possibilities.

**Analogy:**

Think of langchain.core as the engine of a car. It provides the basic functionality for the car to run. langchain_community is like all the additional features you can install in your car, such as a sunroof or a sound system. These features enhance the car's capabilities but rely on the core engine to function.

**Historical Context:**

Previously, everything was bundled under the single "langchain" package. However, as the project grew, separating functionalities became necessary. This modular approach keeps the core functionalities lean and allows for easier integration of community-developed tools.

## NLTK
NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit. It's a popular open-source library for Python that lets you work with human language data.  Here's a breakdown of what NLTK offers:

* **Focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK is specifically designed for tasks related to NLP, which is the field of computer science concerned with how computers understand and manipulate human language.
* **Suite of Libraries:**  NLTK provides a variety of libraries that handle different NLP tasks. These include:
    * **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into smaller units like words or sentences.
    * **Classification:** Categorizing text data based on its content.
    * **Stemming:** Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
    * **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical function of each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
    * **Parsing:** Understanding the syntactic structure of a sentence.
    * **Semantic Reasoning:** Extracting meaning from text data.
* **Pre-built Resources:** NLTK comes with pre-built resources like corpora (large collections of text) and lexical resources (like WordNet, a database of English words) that you can use in your NLP projects.
* **Open Source and Community-Driven:**  Being open-source, NLTK is free to use and developed by a collaborative community. This allows for continuous improvement and a wide range of contributions.
**Tokenization, embeddings, and chunking are all part of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).**

Overall, NLTK is a powerful tool for anyone interested in working with human language data in Python. It's great for researchers, students, and developers who want to build NLP applications.


## TF-IDF 
TF-IDF, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a statistical technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval. It helps evaluate how important a word is to a specific document in a collection of documents.

Here's how it works:

* **Two Components:** TF-IDF combines two ideas:
    * **Term Frequency (TF):** This captures how often a word appears in a particular document. The more a word shows up, the higher its TF score.
    * **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** This considers how common the word is across all documents in the collection. If a word appears frequently in many documents, its IDF score will be low, indicating it's not very distinctive. Conversely, a word unique to a few documents will have a high IDF score.

* **The Formula:** By multiplying TF and IDF, TF-IDF assigns a weight to each word in a document. This weight reflects how important that word is for understanding the document's content relative to the entire collection.

**Use Cases:**

Here are some common applications of TF-IDF:

* **Information Retrieval:** Search engines often use TF-IDF to rank search results. Words with high TF-IDF scores in a document are considered more relevant to the search query, thus ranking higher.
* **Document Summarization:** By identifying the most important words (high TF-IDF),  TF-IDF can help automatically generate summaries of documents.
* **Text Classification:** Classifying documents into different categories can leverage TF-IDF to identify keywords that distinguish between categories.
* **Topic Modeling:** TF-IDF can be used to identify latent topics within a collection of documents by analyzing the distribution of words.


**Benefits:**

* **Focus on Keywords:** TF-IDF helps identify the keywords that best characterize a document, making it easier to understand its content.
* **Reduced Noise:** By downplaying common words, TF-IDF focuses on words that are more distinctive and informative.


The formula for TF-IDF is as follows:

**TF-IDF = TF * IDF**

Here's a breakdown of the individual components:

* **TF (Term Frequency):** There are several ways to calculate TF, but a common approach is:

    * **TF = ft,d / total_terms_in_d**

    where:
        * ft,d  = number of times term t appears in document d
        * total_terms_in_d = total number of terms in document d (including duplicates)

    This is a simple ratio of a term's frequency in a document to the total number of terms in that document. Other variations include using log scaling or smoothing techniques.

* **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** This component measures how common a term is across all documents in the collection.

    * **IDF = log (N / df_t)**

    where:
        * N = total number of documents in the collection
        * df_t = number of documents that contain term t (document frequency)

    The IDF score increases as the term becomes less frequent in the document collection. The logarithm helps compress the value and ensures scores don't become excessively large.

By multiplying TF and IDF, TF-IDF captures the balance between a term's importance within a specific document (TF) and its distinctiveness across the entire document collection (IDF).

## TF-IDF Vs BM25 (Okapi BM25)
Both TF-IDF and BM25 (Okapi BM25) are techniques used in information retrieval (IR) to assess the relevance of documents to a search query. However, they have some key differences:

**Focus:**

* **TF-IDF:** Focuses on identifying keywords that are unique and important to a specific document within a collection.
* **BM25:** Places more emphasis on how well a document's term frequency aligns with the query's terms.

**Formula:**

* **TF-IDF:** Uses a simpler formula that multiplies term frequency (TF) by inverse document frequency (IDF). 
* **BM25:** Employs a more complex formula that incorporates factors like document length, term frequency saturation within the document, and query term frequency. 

**Strengths:**

* **TF-IDF:**
    * Easy to understand and implement.
    * Effective at identifying keywords that characterize a document.
    * Good for tasks like document summarization or topic modeling.
* **BM25:**
    * Often considered more effective for ranking search results, particularly for short queries.
    * Accounts for document length variations, preventing overly short documents from dominating results.

**Weaknesses:**

* **TF-IDF:**
    * Can be susceptible to very common words swamping the results.
    * Doesn't consider the query itself as heavily as BM25.
* **BM25:**
    * More complex formula requires additional parameters to be tuned.
    * Might not be ideal for tasks like document summarization where keyword identification is crucial.

**Choosing Between Them:**

* **TF-IDF:** A good choice for tasks where keyword identification within documents is important, or when dealing with simpler information retrieval scenarios. 
* **BM25:** Often preferred for ranking search results, especially for short queries where term frequency plays a more significant role.

In conclusion, both TF-IDF and BM25 are valuable tools in information retrieval. The best choice depends on the specific task and desired outcome. 
## BM25Retriever
**BM25Retriever:** This class implements a retrieval method based on BM25 (Okapi BM25) scoring. BM25 focuses on term frequency and considers document length to rank documents relevant to a query. It doesn't involve creating or storing embeddings.
Embeddings: Embeddings are vector representations of text data, capturing semantic relationships between words. They are often used in conjunction with retrieval methods that leverage vector similarity for ranking.
In this case, the BM25Retriever likely works by:

Indexing Keywords: It creates an index of keywords extracted from the documents provided in chunks.
Query Matching: When a query is submitted, the retriever searches for documents in the index that have the highest number of matching keywords based on the BM25 scoring scheme.

The way the BM25Retriever stores and accesses its keyword indexes depends on the specific library you're using. However, here are some common approaches:

**In-Memory Storage:**

This is a likely scenario for many libraries. The keyword indexes are created and stored entirely in the computer's memory during runtime. This provides fast access for retrieval tasks but requires the indexes to be reloaded if the program restarts.
Python Data Structures:

The library might use built-in Python data structures like dictionaries or specialized data structures optimized for fast keyword lookup to store the indexes. These structures reside in memory but can be potentially serialized and saved to disk for persistence.

**External Storage (Optional):**

In some cases, the library might offer the option to store the keyword indexes in an external database or file system. This can be useful for large datasets where memory limitations become an issue or if you want to persist the indexes across program restarts. However, accessing them might involve additional I/O overhead compared to in-memory storage.


## chain_type="stuff"
In LangChain, chain_type="stuff" refers to a specific way of processing documents for use with a large language model (LLM). Here's a breakdown of what "stuff" chain type means:

Simple and Direct Approach: The "stuff" chain type is the most basic document processing method in LangChain. It involves directly feeding all the relevant documents into the LLM's prompt without any additional processing.
How it Works:
You provide a list of documents (text data) that you want the LLM to consider.
The LangChain "stuff" chain simply concatenates all these documents into a single string.
This string becomes the prompt that is fed to the LLM.
Advantages:
Easy to use and implement.
Suitable for scenarios where you have a small number of documents and the LLM can handle the combined context effectively.
Disadvantages:
Limited Context Handling: LLMs often have a limit on the amount of text they can process effectively. With "stuff" chain, if the combined documents exceed this limit, it can lead to errors or inaccurate results.
No Additional Processing: The "stuff" chain doesn't perform any pre-processing or filtering on the documents. This can be inefficient if some documents are irrelevant or redundant to the task.
When to Use "stuff" chain type:

You have a small set of concise documents that are all relevant to the task.
The task requires the LLM to consider all the information from the documents together.
Simplicity is preferred, and complex processing is not necessary.
Alternatives to "stuff" chain type:

LangChain offers other chain types that provide more sophisticated document processing functionalities. Here are some options:

**MapReduce Chain:** 
This chain type breaks down documents into smaller batches and feeds them to the LLM independently. It then combines the results for a final answer. This is useful for handling large document sets that exceed the LLM's context limit.

**Refine Chain:** 
This chain allows you to iteratively refine the documents based on the LLM's output. You can use this to identify the most relevant parts of the documents or remove irrelevant information.
Choosing the Right Chain Type:

The best chain type for your task depends on the size and complexity of your documents, the capabilities of your LLM, and the specific task you want to accomplish.
## Vectorization Vs embedding
Vectorization and embedding are both techniques used to represent text data numerically for further processing in tasks like machine learning or information retrieval. However, there's a key difference in the level of meaning captured:

**Vectorization:**

* **Focus:**  Transforms text data into a numerical representation based on features like word counts or document frequency. 
* **Techniques:** Common vectorization techniques include:
    * **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Assigns weights to words based on their importance within a document and rarity across the document collection.
    * **One-Hot Encoding:** Represents each word as a binary vector with a 1 at its index and 0s elsewhere.
* **Outcome:** The resulting vectors capture the presence and frequency of words, but not necessarily the semantic relationships between them. Similar words might not have similar vector representations.

**Embedding:**

* **Focus:**  Learns a dense vector representation for each word that captures its semantic meaning and relationship to other words. 
* **Techniques:** Embedding techniques often involve neural networks like word2vec or GloVe. These algorithms analyze large text corpora to understand how words co-occur and use that information to create embeddings.
* **Outcome:** The resulting vectors represent not just word presence but also semantic similarity. Words with similar meanings will tend to have closer vector representations in the embedding space.

**Analogy:**

Imagine a library.

* **Vectorization:** Like a simple card catalog, it tells you if a book exists (word presence) and how many copies are available (word frequency).
* **Embedding:** Like a sophisticated knowledge graph, it connects books based on their content and themes, allowing you to find similar books based on meaning.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature | Vectorization | Embedding |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Word presence and frequency | Semantic meaning and relationships |
| Techniques | TF-IDF, One-Hot Encoding | Word2vec, GloVe |
| Outcome | Sparse vectors | Dense vectors |
| Semantic Similarity | Not directly captured | Captured through co-occurrence analysis |

**Choosing Between Them:**

* Vectorization: A good choice for simpler tasks where word presence and frequency are sufficient, or when computational efficiency is a concern.
* Embedding: More powerful for tasks that require understanding semantic relationships between words, like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or machine translation.
In the context of BM25 (Okapi BM25), "Okapi" refers to the information retrieval system where this ranking function was first implemented. It doesn't hold a specific meaning within the BM25 formula itself.


## Okapi BM25
BM25 Stands for: Best Matching
Okapi BM25: This is the full name of the ranking function, indicating its origin in the Okapi information retrieval system developed at London's City University in the 1980s and 1990s.
Over time, BM25 gained widespread adoption due to its effectiveness, and the "Okapi" part became less prominent. Today, BM25 is often referred to simply as "BM25" without implying its origin in the Okapi system.
